const CareerBio = `I am a software engineer looking to use my extensive, diverse experience as foundation for building
sustainable, user-driven apps.

In working in the answering service industry, I provided a variety of customer service experiences for large cross-section of organizations & industries. As a training mentor, I helped my coworkers understand how to manage professionalism while handling a different account from call to call. As a manager, I worked to understand each account's needs to deliver a plan of how to best streamline the experience for the accountholders, their callers, and our own team.

It was part of the inspiration to work on programmatic solutions that worked for people who do not feel comfortable with technology. When I started taking online JavaScript classes, I already had the experience of designing & writing customized, scripted workflows in pseudo-code. Drawing from applicable past experience helps frame and accelerate my understanding of everything from migration libraries to React lifecycle methods.

After attending Hackbright Academy in SF, I connected with Carey Flack, an Oklahoma-based entrepreneur, who was looking for a software engineer to help build an app to facilitate learning Indigenous languages. I initially joined Bloom as a front-end software engineer, and shortly after I became the lead engineer on the project and later CTO. At Bloom I supervised a web developer and another engineer in building the app using React, Node and Firestore. In addition to training our web dev in version control & some JS, I provided advice regarding design & strategy and did some fundraising.`;
