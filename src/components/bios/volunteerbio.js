const VolunteerBio = `I spent four years as a community organizer in Chicago & Stockton for local organizations comprised of primarily service workers, farm workers & others low-income people. It was a mutual aid system of food & clothing distributions and free preventive medical & dental services. As a full-time volunteer for four years, I worked alongside other low-income members in getting food donations from grocers & wholesalers, monetary donations from local individuals & businesses to pay the office rent & utilities, and recruiting other volunteers from the membership and the community at large. I also helped organize several fundraiser benefits, two anniversary dinners, and the production of a few issues of the newsletter & sponsor's guide.

I have also had the opportunity to coach the Mock Trial team at my alma mater Tracy High School, helping them go to state competition in 2010-2011.`;
